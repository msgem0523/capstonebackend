# GrowthGuard App Backend  
[Backend Repo](https://github.com/msgem0523/capstonebackend) | [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/msgem0523/capstonefrontend)

## Overview  
The **GrowthGuard App** backend powers a full-stack web application that helps parents track their child's medical history and developmental milestones. Built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, this RESTful API serves secure endpoints for managing users, childrenâ€™s profiles, and health records.

## Features  
âœ… **User Authentication** â€“ (Planned) Secure login with JWT or Firebase Auth  
âœ… **Medical Logging** â€“ Store vaccination history, allergy info, prescriptions, and doctor visits  
âœ… **Milestone Tracking** â€“ Log developmental milestones based on age groups  
âœ… **RESTful API** â€“ Designed for clean integration with the frontend  
âœ… **MongoDB Integration** â€“ Mongoose schemas with validation and security in mind  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB + Mongoose  
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT) *(Coming Soon)*  
- **Environment Variables:** dotenv  
- **Security:** bcrypt, CORS  
- **Testing:** Postman for route testing

---

## How It Works  
1. Backend serves as the API layer for the React frontend.  
2. It exposes endpoints to create and manage user accounts, childrenâ€™s profiles, and health records.  
3. Includes secure authentication setup (in progress) and robust data validation with Mongoose.

## API Endpoints (Sample)

| Method | Route               | Description                      |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/register`     | Register new user                |
| POST   | `/api/login`        | Login and receive JWT token      |
| GET    | `/api/children`     | Get all children for a user      |
| POST   | `/api/children`     | Add a new child                  |
| PUT    | `/api/children/:id` | Update a childâ€™s profile         |
| DELETE | `/api/children/:id` | Delete a child                   |

*(These may vary depending on implementation; update as needed.)*
